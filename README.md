# OARepo DOI

OARepo DOI adds community-specific DOI configuration to OARepo/InvenioRDM
installations. It provides a DOI settings service and administration views, and
extends the DataCite PID provider so DOI registration can use credentials
configured for the record's default community or for the default fallback
configuration.

## Features

- Stores DataCite credentials per community.
- Resolves DOI credentials from a record's default community.
- Supports a default DOI settings record with `community_slug` set to `*`,
  used when the record has no matching community DOI settings.
- Falls back to the standard global DataCite configuration when neither
  community-specific nor default DOI settings exist.
- Registers DOI settings in the Invenio administration interface.
- Keeps DataCite passwords encrypted in the database.

## Installation

The package is intended to be installed as part of an OARepo 14 based
application.

```bash
pip install oarepo-doi
```

## DOI Settings

Each DOI settings record connects a community, or the default fallback, to
DataCite credentials:

- `community_slug`: slug of the community using these DOI credentials, or `*`
  for default DOI settings
- `prefix`: DataCite DOI prefix
- `username`: DataCite username
- `password`: DataCite password, stored encrypted

Only one DOI settings record can exist for a given community slug.
Only one default DOI settings record with `community_slug` set to `*` can exist.

The service is registered under the `community-doi` service id and uses the
`doi-settings` search alias.

## REST API

The DOI settings resource is exposed under:

```text
/doi_settings
/doi_settings/<id>
```

The resource supports reading, updating and deleting DOI settings records.
Search, create, update and delete operations are protected by the DOI settings
permission policy and are available to system processes and administration
users.

Example payload:

```json
{
  "community_slug": "example-community",
  "prefix": "10.12345",
  "username": "datacite-user",
  "password": "datacite-password"
}
```

Default fallback settings use `*` as the community slug:

```json
{
  "community_slug": "*",
  "prefix": "10.12345",
  "username": "datacite-user",
  "password": "datacite-password"
}
```

When a DOI settings record is created or updated, the referenced community must
exist. If the community slug cannot be found, the service returns a bad request.
The special `*` community slug is reserved for default DOI settings and does not
need to match an existing community.

## DataCite Integration

The package provides two record-aware DataCite classes:

- `oarepo_doi.services.providers.client:DataCiteRecordAwareClient`
- `oarepo_doi.services.providers.provider:DataCiteRecordAwareProvider`

The provider binds the current record to the DataCite client before DOI
generation, registration, update, restore and delete operations. The client then
looks up DOI settings for the record's default community.

When community DOI settings are found, DOI generation uses the community prefix
and the DataCite API client is created from the community username, password and
prefix. When no settings exist for the record's default community, the client
tries the default DOI settings record where `community_slug` is `*`. This default
record also applies to records without a default community.

If neither community-specific nor default DOI settings are found, the
implementation falls back to the standard InvenioRDM DataCite client and global
`DATACITE_*` configuration.

## Configuration

The DataCite client also respects the standard global DataCite configuration
when no community-specific or `*` DOI settings are available, including:

```python
DATACITE_PREFIX = "10.12345"
DATACITE_USERNAME = "user"
DATACITE_PASSWORD = "password"
DATACITE_FORMAT = "{prefix}/{id}"
DATACITE_TEST_MODE = True
```
